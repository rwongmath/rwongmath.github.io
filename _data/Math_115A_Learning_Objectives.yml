  name: The language of mathematics
  description: Construct mathematical proofs using common techniques (direct proof; contrapositive; contradiction, etc.). Describe and identify sets.  Describe and identify functions between sets. Generalize the properties of $\mathbb{R}$ to the definition of a field. Identify if a set (with a given addition and multiplication) is a field.

  name: Vector spaces
  description: Generalize the properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the definition of a vector space over a field.  Reason with vector space axioms.  Prove that collections are vector spaces or subspaces.  Determine if a set of vectors are linearly independent, a spanning set, or a basis.  Calculate coordinate vectors.
