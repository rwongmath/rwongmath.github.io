In Fall 2018, I was the TA for UGS 303, a [Signature Course](https://ugs.utexas.edu/sig) titled "From Numbers to Chaos". Signature Courses are designed to introduce first-year and/or transfer students to the universityâ€™s academic community through the exploration of new interests. It is an opportunity for students to learn how to engage in college-level thinking and learning.
