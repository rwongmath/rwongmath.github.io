# CalcLab

As the instructor of record for this course, I ran the [CalcLab](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate/calclab), which is a program where students enrolled in calculus courses can receive help from TAs, and work with their classmates.

I transitioned CalcLab to an online calculus resource through Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic.
