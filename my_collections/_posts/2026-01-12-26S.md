This semester, I will be teaching [Math 102](/teaching/math-102) and Math 232 (Honors Multivariable Calculus).

**If you are interested in taking Math 232, you should send me an email.** You are welcome to attend lectures as a guest before the add/drop deadline, and you should also talk to me before/after class to be added to the course Canvas page.
