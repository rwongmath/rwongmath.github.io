I will be attending [MAA Mathfest 2025](https://maa.org/event/mathfest/) in Sacramento, CA.  

<!--end_excerpt-->

I will be giving [a presentation](/assets/slides/MMT_Mathfest_2025.pdf) on Midweek Math Training at Rice.

I (along with [José Pastrana](https://sites.google.com/view/jpastrana)) will also be presenting [a poster](/assets/materials/2025_HHMI_Driving_Change_Mathfest_poster.pdf) on Year 1 of the HHMI Driving Change efforts in redesigning Calc I and II.
