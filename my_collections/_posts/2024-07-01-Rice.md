I am excited to join the Rice University Department of Mathematics as an assistant teaching professor.  

I am part of a cluster hire in the [HHMI Driving Change initiative](https://news.rice.edu/news/2023/rice-receives-25m-grant-support-inclusive-stem-education).  In particular, we are currently focusing on how calculus is taught at Rice.
