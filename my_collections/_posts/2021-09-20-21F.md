This quarter, I will be teaching Math 32A (Calculus of Several Variables) and Math 32AH (Calculus of Several Variables, Honors). 

 **If you are interested in taking 32AH, you should send me an email.** You are welcome to attend lectures as a guest before the add/drop deadline, and you should also talk to me before/after class to be added to the course Canvas page.
