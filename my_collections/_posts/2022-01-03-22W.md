**Note:** Due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant, these courses were taught in an online asynchronous format for most of the quarter.
{: .notice--warning}

This quarter, I will be teaching Math 32B (Calculus of Several Variables) and Math 32BH (Calculus of Several Variables, Honors).  

**If you are interested in taking 32BH, you should send me an email.** You are welcome to attend lectures as a guest before the add/drop deadline, and you should also talk to me before/after class to be added to the course Canvas page.
