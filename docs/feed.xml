&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to prove a theorem?&lt;/strong&gt;  Why are the theorems you saw in Math 33A true?  How do we generalize the properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;115A is the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; course in linear algebra.  In math 33A, you learned the computational tools of linear algebra in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In math 115A, you will learn how to prove the theorems and tools you saw in 33A.  Moreover, you will generalize these theorems to the setting of abstract vector spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;115A may also be your first exposure to mathematical proofs.  In other words, this course will help you develop the mathematical reasoning and questioning skills needed to explore abstract mathematical concepts. Moreover, you will become fluent in communicating your mathematical ideas, and you will develop the ability to prove (or find counterexamples) to mathematical statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course provides the foundation for exploring other topics in advanced mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we describe the physical world mathematically?&lt;/strong&gt;  What changes, and what stays the same when we move from single variable calculus to multivariable calculus?  What does it mean to take a integral of a multivariable function? What kinds of functions can we integrate? How far can we &lt;em&gt;generalize&lt;/em&gt; the notion of integration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multivariable calculus is the mathematical language that allows us to describe the geometry of the physical world around us, such as the areas, volumes, or mass of objects; the behaviors of electromagnetic fields or fluids in space; or calculating the amount of wind blowing through the hills of Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
