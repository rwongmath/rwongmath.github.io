Here you can find sample teaching materials that I've created.

## Syllabus

Below is a sample syllabus for Math 32A.

## Lecture Slides

In my classes, I use Beamer to create lecture slides.  I post them the day before lecture, so that students can review them before lecture.

Lecture slides for Math 32A, from the first day of class.

I also post lecture recordings and annotated lecture slides after class so that students can focus on listening and thinking about the material.

Annotated lecture slides for Math 32B, which describe the geometric interpretations of Stoke's theorem and the divergence theorem.

## Challenge Problem Reports

Challenge Problem Reports are technical writing assignments, where students will apply the course material to more challenging (real world) problems. 

They are designed to develop both mathematical reasoning and mathematical communication skills. The reports are graded on both the *correctness* of the mathematics, as well as how the mathematical ideas are *explained*.

* [Math 32AH Challenge Problem Report 1](/assets/materials/22F_32AH_Challenge_Report1.pdf), on the geometry of linear maps.
* [Math 32B Challenge Problem Report 2](/assets/materials/23S_32B_Challenge_Report2.pdf), on the MÃ¶bius strip.

## Lecture Notes

I created lecture notes for the honors multivariable calculus sequence (Math 32AH/BH) at UCLA.  [They can be found on Github](https://github.com/rwongmath/HonorsMultivariableCalculus/blob/main/HonorsMultivariableCalculus.pdf).
