<div class="standout" markdown="1">

I grew up in central New Jersey, and went to Rutgers for undergrad.  As an incoming freshman, I had no idea what I would study - I was considering majoring in anything ranging from English, Psychology, Computer Science, or Mathematics.

At the time, I had been placed into multivariable calculus, but I sucessfully petitioned to take the honors lecture, instead. This course changed my perception about mathematics in two fundamental ways:

* I learned that mathematics is more than just calculations - it is about communicating ideas and concepts.
* I also learned that mathematics is best done collaboratively.

At the end of the course, the TA encouraged me to pursue further classes in mathematics (including the honors seminar in mathematics).  

I quickly discovered that I enjoyed proof-based mathematics, and I especially enjoyed my classes in abstract algebra and topology as an undergraduate.  I ultimately chose to study algebraic topology (unsurprisingly) for my Ph.D at UT Austin.  I've been lucky to make many friends there, and I've been able to meet many other wonderful people through math conferences and travel. 

 After graduating, I took a postdoc at UCLA, to both teach and do research.  I quickly discovered that I enjoyed teaching and making an impact on my students.  I decided to focus more on the teaching aspect of my job (though I still made time for some research).  In particular, I especially enjoyed teaching Math 32AH/BH (honors multivariable calculus), and Math 94 (summer bridge program).

Now that I'm an assistant teaching professor at Rice, I'm striving to encourage and inspire future generations of mathematicians, as well.

# Frisbee

Nowadays, I am more likely to be playing disc golf.  However, I started playing ultimate in high school.  I played in college for 4 years with Rutgers Machine, where we won the Metro East region to go to College Nationals in 2014. I played my 5th and final year of college ultimate with Texas TUFF in 2016.

From 2016-2020, I was co-captain of SO(2), the UT Austin math department team for the intramural coed ultimate league.
