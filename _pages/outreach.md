>"Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences."


<cite>--- [Federico Ardila](http://fardila.com/)</cite>
{: .small} 

I strongly believe that **EVERYONE** is capable of success in mathematics, and I am committed to making mathematics more accessible and inclusive for all.  In particular, I believe that we must actively work to break down any systemic barriers that exist due to race, gender, socio-economic background, or cultural identity. If you're new to these ideas, send me an email - I'm happy to have a conversation with you!

I have engaged in outreach efforts at multiple levels to help others overcome these barriers, which include: providing academic support and mentorship; creating supportive and welcoming mathematical communities; and recruiting future generations of mathematicians through outreach.

# Efforts

## HHMI Success in STEM Initiative

At Rice, I am a member of the HHMI Success in STEM initiative.  Our goal is to redesign Calculus I and II in an accessible way that is inclusive and equitable for all students.

[José Pastrana](https://sites.google.com/view/jpastrana) and I presented [a poster](/assets/materials/2025_HHMI_Driving_Change_Mathfest_poster.pdf) on Year 1 of our efforts at the 2025 Mathfest.

## Summer BRIDGE Program

In Summer 2023, I worked with Britney Robinson, Bon-Soon Lin, and the UCLA Division of Physical Sciences to create and teach a Summer Bridge Program  ([Math 94: Explorations of Mathematics in the Physical World](/teaching/math-94)) for incoming first-year STEM studemts from FGLI or URM backgrounds.

## MOCAT

Some of the activities I've helped to organize include:

* A virtual UT Austin Math Graduate School Recruitment Event
* The Existence and Uniqueness Book Club
* Graduate Student Office Hours

In 2021, we received a [Tensor SUMMA 2021 Grant](https://www.maa.org/node/1378448).

# Community Outreach

I'm happy to work with local communities to promote mathematics!   If you'd like me to speak at your student organization, send me an email.
