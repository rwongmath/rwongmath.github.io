>"Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences."

I am committed to actively promoting and supporting **diversity, inclusivity, and equity in mathematics**. I believe that in order to **make mathematics more accessible and inclusive for all**, one must actively work to break down the systemic barriers that exist due to race, gender, socio-economic background, or cultural identity. If you're new to these ideas, send me an email - I'm happy to have a conversation with you!

I have engaged in outreach efforts at multiple levels to help others overcome these barriers, which include: providing academic support and mentorship; creating supportive and welcoming mathematical communities; and recruiting future generations of mathematicians through outreach.

## EDI Efforts

### Summer BRIDGE Program

In Summer 2023, I worked with Britney Robinson, Bon-Soon Lin, and the UCLA Division of Physical Sciences to create and teach a Summer Bridge Program for incoming first-years who identify as underrepresented minorities or low income groups in the Physical Sciences.

### MOCAT

Our goal is to create a community of undergraduate and graduate math students of color to recruit, retain, support, and empower underrepresented students in mathematics." %}

Some of the activities I've helped to organize include:

* A virtual UT Austin Math Graduate School Recruitment Event
* The Distinguished Mathematician of Color Colloquium Series
* The Existence and Uniqueness Book Club
* The What is... Series, a series of expository talks
* Graduate Student Office Hours
* Latex Workshops

In 2021, we received a [Tensor SUMMA 2021 Grant](https://www.maa.org/node/1378448).

## Community Outreach

I'm happy to work with local communities to promote mathematics!   If you'd like me to speak at your student organization, send me an email.
