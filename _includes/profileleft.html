<p>In addition to teaching, I like thinking about <a href="https://rwongmath.github.io/research/nontechnical">algebraic topology</a>. Prior to coming to Rice, I was at postdoc in the <a href="https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/research-areas/topology/">algebraic topology group</a> at UCLA.</p>

	<!-- <p>I'm part of the <a href="https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/research-areas/topology/">algebraic topology group</a>, and my mentor is Mike Hill.</p> -->
	
	<p>I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from the University of Texas at Austin, where I was advised by Andrew Blumberg. Previously I was an undergraduate at Rutgers University, where I graduated in 2015 with highest honors in mathematics and a minor in cognitive science. </p>
